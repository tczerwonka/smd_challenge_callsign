# smd_challenge_callsign

This project is for the Atmel ATTINY85 used on the SMD Challenge board.
I built a second and wanted it to do something other than just cycle
through the LEDs, so this one blinks my callsign.

The code is not clever, clean, nor anything to be proud of, but it
got the job done.

This was programmed on the ATTINY85 using the "Arduino as ISP" technique
and http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695 for directions on adding support to
the Arduino IDE for programming the ATTINY.
